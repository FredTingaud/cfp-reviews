exports.title=`The goal of your title is simple: tell people what your talk is about. Secondary goals are to encourage people to read more about the talk and to attract them, but if the main goal is not reached, they will almost certainly fail too.

You can try to put a joke in your title. But it can backfire... Your joke has to be original! Multiple talks having the same joke in their title is something that happens pretty often and being one of them can frustrate a little bit the reviewers.
        
Something way worst than unoriginal jokes, though, are titles of the form “Make XXX Great Again”. Those are not just unoriginal, they are also not funny and actively hurtful to many reviewers and attendees.`;
exports.track=`<h5>Progress</h3>
<p>This track is all about the bases. These are the talks that you wish every new C++ developer would listen to early in their career to start on the right foot. They can be very valuable to experts but need to be accessible to students and beginners.</p>
<p><em>eg: How to use the STL algorithms? What is “the rule of 0” and when to use it?</em></p>
<h5>Produce</h5>
<p>This track is for talks that can be immediately applied by professional C++ programmers in their everyday job. Concrete tools and pragmatic ideas that work for legacy codebases and scale well with big teams.</p>
<p><em>eg: How to start testing legacy code? How to do good code reviews?</em></p>
<h5>Push Forward</h5>
<p>Talks in this track propose novel ideas and approaches for C++. They can be patterns that are not well known yet, new features coming in the language, libraries using these recent features or new ways to think about old problems.</p>
<p><em>eg: What could C++ learn from functional programming? What will C++ 20 modules look like?</em></p>

exports.experience=`If you have experience giving talks, you can present them here. Not having experience is of course not eliminatory.`;
exports.bio=`Your bio should be written in third person.

When attendees look at your bio, it is to know *your perspective* on the subject you are talking about.

Are you giving a talk about library XXX as a maintainer of the library? A power user in the industry? Or somebody who tried it in their side project?
None of these is inherently better or worst, but it will give a very different talk. It should be possible to find that information in your bio.`;
exports.abstract=`The abstract is a short text where you present your talk to the attendees. It will be part of the program and is with the title, the only information attendees will have to select which talk they want to attend. Thus, you should polish it for them and make sure that it makes perfect sense on its own.

It should first contain an explanation of what the talk is about *written for your target audience*. For example, if your talk is an introduction to sorting algorithm you might not want to name all the algorithms you will mention, because the people you are targeting have no idea what they are yet!

As important as explaining what the talk is about, your abstract should also explain *why your target attendee cares* about the subject. If you don't expect them to have knowledge of your subject, you need to explain to them why your talk is relevant to their interest.

By reading your abstract, an attendee should also find what the takeaway from your talk will be for them. It can be in a very litteral way by saying something along the line of “the takeaway from this presentation will be a basic understanding of sorting algorithms” or it can be something more subtle. If attendees can know in advance what they will learn in your talk, they will be able to make a better decision on whether they should attend.

If your talk takes an original approach or angle, or is different from other talks about similar subjects, *make sure that it appears in your abstract*. 

Finally, you might also want to indicate clearly who you are targeting. If you give a talk about sorting algorithms, do you expect attendees to have some algorithmic knowledge and for example know about algorithmic complexity? Mentioning it can avoid either people not understanding the talk or be afraid to attend.

exports.outline=`The outline is a small presentation of the structure you imagine for your talk. It will not be seen by the attendees, but it is crucial for the reviewers of your CfP. It is with this text that they must judge whether you have a good grasp on the subject and how to present it. Here too, you should make sure it is written with the right target in mind.

What you want to tell the program committee is first *how* you want to present the subject. What is the structure of your talk? What are the key ideas you want the attendees to remember?

And secondly, how far in the details you want to go. If you are giving a talk about introduction to sorting algorithms, you should indeed not list them all in the abstract. But you want to list them in the outline. The reviewers should have that kind of information to make an educated review of your talk.`;

exports.name=`This field is for the name that will appear under your video. It should be the name you want to present yourself as in the community and does not need to match your legal papers.`;

exports.affiliation=`The organization that sent you to the conference (if any)`;

exports.duration=`The default duration for a talk is 60 minutes including the attendees questions`;

exports.language=`If your talk can only be done in French, choose Français and fill the form in French. Otherwise, use English.`;

exports.tags=`A comma separated list of keywords describing high level themes of your talk.`;
