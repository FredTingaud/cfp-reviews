        <h2> Who should propose a talk?</h2>

        <p>Anybody who wants to!</p>

        <p>We love having famous talented speakers but are also looking for new voices that will make our conference
            novel.</p>

        <p>We are interested in new subjects and new persepectives on known subjects! We are striving for a diversity of
            backgrounds (technical and human), approaches and experience.</p>

        <h2>What should you talk about?</h2>

        <p>We are looking for talks that are relevant to C++ programmers. Which does not mean that all talks need to be
            about code. CPPP has three tracks with different perspectives and we recommend to think your talk so that it
            fits well with one of them.</p>

        <p>If you want to propose multiple talks, targetting multiple tracks can increase your chances of being
            selected.</p>

        <p>If new materials are preferred, we also accept submissions of talks already presented in other conferences if
            the topic and delivery fit our targets.</p>

        <h3>Progress</h3>

        <p>This track is all about the bases. These are the talks that you wish every new C++ developer would listen to
            early in their career to start on the right foot. They can be very valuable to experts but need to be
            accessible to students and beginners.</p>

        <p><em>eg: How to use the STL algorithms? What is "the rule of 0" and when to use it?</em></p>

        <h3>Produce</h3>

        <p>This track is for talks that can be immediately applied by professional C++ programmers in their everyday
            job. Concrete tools and pragmatic ideas that work for legacy codebases and scale well with big teams.</p>

        <p><em>eg: How to start testing legacy code? How to do good code reviews?</em></p>

        <h3>Push Forward</h3>

        <p>Talks in this track propose novel ideas and approaches for C++. They can be patterns that are not well known
            yet, new features coming in the language, libraries using these recent features or new ways to think about
            old problems.</p>

        <p><em>eg: What could C++ learn from functional programming? What will pattern matching look like?</em></p>

        <h2>How to write your proposal?</h2>

        <p>Every field in the form is explained in details to help you write the most effective proposal. These
            explanations
            are a shorter version of <a href="https://fredtingaud.github.io/talking-cfp/" target="blank">this blog
                post</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Once you submitted your proposal, you can still come back and modify it until the end of the Call for
            Proposals.
            You can also save your work in progress and come back to finish it afterward.
        </p>

        <p>If you feel unsure about how your talk or how to present it, you can ask us for help! Contact
            <a href="mailto:presentation@cppp.fr">presentation@cppp.fr</a> with your questions and talk ideas and we can
            help you.
            Try doing it as soon as possible to ensure there is enough time for us to answer you and for you to have
            enough time to write your proposal before the deadline.
        </p>

        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

        <p>As a speaker, you will be key in how attendees enjoy their conference. That is why you will also be held to a
            high standard regarding your language and behavior while on stage. No oppressive humour will be tolerated
            and we ask you to try your best to avoid vocabulary that can make part of the public feel ignored or
            excluded. If you have doubts about a joke or part of your talk and want to discuss it, you can contact us at
            <a href="mailto:presentation@cppp.fr">presentation@cppp.fr</a> and we can help you.
        </p>

        <h2>How we will review</h2>

        <p>All proposals will be reviewed "anonymously". Which means that reviewers will only have access
            to the fields describing the content of the talk and not the fields related to the speaker. The anonymity is
            not
            perfect because some authors might still be identifiable through their abstract, but we believe it should
            still
            work for the wide majority of the proposals.
        </p>

        <p>After the anonymous review, the conference organizers will have access to all information about the author
            and can
            amend their review. These changes are visible to all the juree members who already reviewed the same
            proposal.
        </p>

        <p>The rating given to the proposals are of course taken into account, but the organizers can decide to select
            or refuse
            a talk despite it's rating to ensure a better diversity of subjects. For example, if there are three talks
            with very near subjects and
            high ratings, the organizers can decide to refuse the lowest rated proposal among the three. Conversely, a
            proposal
            with a lower rating on an important subject that is not covered otherwise might be accepted.
